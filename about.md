Hi! I'm Janice Loo, a UI/UX Designer born and raised in New York City. My passion is to contribute to the world through empathetic problem solving and thoughtful design. I appreciate exploring different mediums of art and food with old and new company. On my off time, writing, reading and jamming to some music is a must. If you're interested in what I'm up to, I'd love to hear from you!
